# AI & Robotics Knowledge Base

## Overview
This project implements a **logical reasoning system** using **forward and backward chaining** to infer relationships in the domain of **artificial intelligence and robotics**. The system defines AI-related concepts, their properties, and logical inference rules to derive new knowledge based on given premises.

## Features
- **Forward Chaining:** Automatically derives conclusions based on known facts and rules.
- **Backward Chaining:** Determines the conditions required for a specific conclusion.
- **AI & Robotics Knowledge Base:** Includes AI models, robotics engineers, game AI, and deep learning systems.

## Structure
1. **Knowledge Base** (`&kb`)  
   - Stores known facts about AI models, robotics, and their characteristics.
   - Example facts:
     - `GPT generates text`
     - `AlphaGo plays strategic games`
     - `Boston Dynamics builds robots`

2. **Rule Base** (`&rb`)  
   - Defines inference rules for AI concepts.
   - Example rules:
     - If an entity **generates text** and **learns from data**, it is an **AI model**.
     - If an entity **builds robots** and **designs technology**, it is a **robotic engineer**.

3. **Forward Chaining** (`fc` function)
   - Starts with known facts and applies rules iteratively to infer new facts.
   - Example:
     - If `GPT generates text` and `GPT learns from data`, the system infers `GPT is an AI model`.

4. **Backward Chaining** (`bc_ai` function)
   - Starts with a goal (e.g., *What is an AI model?*) and works backward to find supporting facts.
   - Example:
     - Given the goal `Inheritance $what AI_Model`, the system traces rules and finds candidates like `GPT`.

## Running the System
1. **Forward Chaining:**
   ```lisp
   !(fc (Evaluation generates GPT) (fromNumber 2))
   ```
   - This will infer related properties of `GPT` and other AI models.

2. **Backward Chaining:**
   ```lisp
   !(bc_ai (Inheritance $what AI_Model) (fromNumber 2))
   ```
   - This queries the system to determine what qualifies as an `AI_Model`.

## Applications
- AI reasoning and classification.
- Robotics decision-making logic.
- Knowledge representation and automated inference.
- Educational use for learning AI-related logical systems.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the knowledge base with more AI-related concepts.
- Add probabilistic reasoning for uncertain knowledge.
- Integrate with external AI models for real-time inference.
